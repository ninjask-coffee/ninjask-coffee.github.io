I'm a Telecommunications Engineer who now works in Information Security. I'm driven by curiosity and a love for good challenges, which led me to become a cybersecurity enthusiast.

This site is where I document my passions. You'll find posts on many topics—from cyber to coffee—all focused on learning, having fun, and maybe helping someone along the way. Welcome.
